Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 :-

HTTP:-

=> HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol".
=> It is used in client-server communication.
=> By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
=> There are several stages of development of HTTP

    Version 	Year    Current status
   1.HTTP/0.9	1991	Obsolete
   2.HTTP/1.0	1996	Obsolete
   3.HTTP/1.1	1997	Standard
   4.HTTP/2     2015	Standard
   5.HTTP/3	    2022 	Standard

=> We will focus mainly on.
1. HTTP/1.1 
2. HTTP/2 

HTTP/1.1 :-
=> It works on the textual format
=> It compresses data by itself.
=> It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
=> There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind 
it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
=> In HTTP/1.1, this was easy, as head-of-line blocking made it simple 
to load various assets in the correct order.

HTTP/2 :-
=> It works on the binary protocol.
=> It uses HPACK for data compression.
=> It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
=> It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
=> In HTTP/2, this was solved using priority sends in the request (so need to multiple calls) 
based on the priority you will receive a response in corresponding order.
