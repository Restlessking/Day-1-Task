Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript :-

=> Objects are important data types in javascript. 
=> Objects are different than primitive datatypes i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.
=> Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.
=> hese keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively,
 in the context of an object.
 
 1. The syntax for adding a property to an object is :-
    "ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;"

 2. The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:-
    "delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;"

 3. The syntax to access a property from an object is:-
    "objectName.property        
           //or
     objectName["property”]     
           //or
     objectName[expression]"

 Example:-

   var myCar = new Object();

   myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

   myCar.model = 'Altros';

   myCar.year = 1978;

   myCar.wheels = 2;

=> After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.

   myCar.year

   Output: 1978
